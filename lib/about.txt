.pretty folders store footprints. Individual footprints are stored in .kicad_mod files 

.kicad_sym store symbol libraries. 


.dcm & .lib work together to store symbol libraries. 
.mod works to store footprints

.dcm, .mod, .lib are legacy & redundant file storage methods since version 5.x.x


The 3d folder will store the 3d models which you can sometimes add to footprints.

The newest version of kicad has a new library type called "design blocks" which use the .kicad_blocks file format. Design blocks allow you to reuse schematics. We are not using the feature yet.
